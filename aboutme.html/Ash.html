<h1>My Poem</h1>
<p>
    The kitchen was warm with a scent </p>

    <p>Of Nepali cookings, with adults talking</p>
    <p>To kids running and crying</p>
   <p>With aunties gossiping and telling legends.</p> 
   <p>I am from Nepal with blood from Bhutan.</p> 
   <p>I am a Nepali kid who was Americanized.</p> 
   <p>From trying too hard to be in the culture.</p> 
   <p>From being too whitewashed and excluded from my own culture.</p> 
   <p>I am from shantytown </p> 
    <p>Where everyone wanted their piece</p>
    <p>You canâ€™t share because that was to caring</p>
 <p>And no you can't be to friendly </p> 
   <p>Because if you have to much you have to be careful on who would knock you down</p> 
    <p>You see I am from shantytown a place that defined a human being </p>
   <p>Without explanation you would judge and exclude an innocent child</p> 
    <p>Who was just seeking peace trying to see where he fits in.</p>
    <p>I am from shantytown where there was similar kids like me</p>
    <p>with a sweet tone A nepali kid became a pimp to a butterfly. </p>
